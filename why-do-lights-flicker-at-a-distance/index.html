<p>The light travels from the star in the distance through the atmosphere and down to us on the ground because of the hot and cold air. Hot air has lower density and thus lower refractive index than colder air, so a pocket of warmer air will slightly distort the path light takes from its source to your eye. Led lights flicker on camera because they require an alternating current to power up and in such a current, the electrons move in cycles every second called hertz. Why do my lights flicker at 10pm?

<p>The starlight is caused by the movement of air in the atmosphere of earth. Variations in air density cause the light to refract along its path from the source to your eye. Led lights flicker on camera because they require an alternating current to power up and in such a current, the electrons move in cycles every second called hertz. Atmosphere can in fact refract photons to different directions, what makes far away stars with narrow beam of photons to flicker, but that do not happen easily on very short.
