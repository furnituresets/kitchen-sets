<p>A lot of people are now using constant voltage drivers and wiring up. Now as they are connected in parallel. We should always wire lights in parallel because the lights have usually same voltage rating and parallel circuits provide same voltage across each end. Wiring leds in parallel can be very similar to wiring single leds.</p>

<p>We should always wire lights in parallel because the lights have usually same voltage rating and parallel circuits provide same voltage across each end. Connecting leds in series means less resistors and simpler. P = iv p =.020a x 2v since this is being calculated for the resistor we have to say that the current going through the resistor is that of the led (.020a) and the voltage drop is 2v. And i have also shown how to select. Super Bright 12V LED Light Interior, Project &amp; Retail, Casino LEDs.</p>

<h3 id="parallel-wiring-is-most-often-used-when-working-with-constant-voltage-drivers">Parallel Wiring Is Most Often Used When Working With Constant Voltage Drivers.</h3><p>If your driver generates 36v, each led will experience 36v across it in parallel wiring. Only problem is if the supply voltage doesn't allow. 0.5v * 0.02a * 16 = 0.16 watts 0.16w + 1.02w = 1.18 watts. Wiring leds in parallel can be very similar to wiring single leds.</p>
