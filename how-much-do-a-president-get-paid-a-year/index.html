<p>In 1909, the president’s salary was raised again to $75,000 a year, which would be $2.3 million a. This presidential pay raise was the first since 1969, when the president's salary was raised from $100,000 to $200,000. In 2012 when the white paper was released, the formula yielded an mr4 minister annual salary of $1.1 million, which was a reduction of 31% from the previous framework. Adjusted for inflation, $200,000 in 1969 would be worth $930,232 today.</p>
